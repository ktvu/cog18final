    "Simple text-based adventure created from my mind because I wanted to have a little fun. Inspiration comes from the mobile game called Identity V, a survival horror game by NetEase. Roles from the game such as \"nurse\", \"mechanic\", and \"Gamekeeper\" were used in this adventure, though the plot is not exactly the same. Other inspiration comes from the short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\" by Richard Connell."
